## How does it works?

### First page is a home page with two buttons:

- About Developer

</p>

### "Dating" page
Here you can get any jokes of the Chuck in two different ways:
1) User can push the buttons under the card for like or dislike. However, nobody can dislike Chuck, therefore user will be seeing some floating window in such case

2) User can swipe right for like and left for dislike. It is possible with the use of GestureDetector in Flutter
